# WCA Community Survey (DRAFT)

Everything in this document is up for feedback and debate! This is expected to go through significant revisions.

- Each survey will be tied to a WCA website account.
  - We can do this using [custom variables](https://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_US/kb/What-are-custom-variables-and-how-do-I-use-them) with SurveyMonkey using their paid plan. This is $32 for one month (or $23 if we demonstrate non-profit status), which I (Lucas) am happy to contribute personally.
  - This means responses from competitors with WCA IDs can be associated with their competition results. This allows us to break down results by region, or by how recently someone competed.
- Results will be available to any WCA staff member who asks the WCT.
  - This survey is designed so that we don't collect any sensitive information. We'll probably want to run bucketed or anonymized stats based on competitor ages, but this should be restricted to a very limited number of software team members.
- Every answer except the first one is optional.

# Events

### [ALL] The WCA plans to remove the 3x3x3 With Feet event in 2020, due to concerns about hygiene, extra setup work, and limited popularity. Do you agree with this decision?
- Yes (remove 3x3x3 With Feet)
- No (keep 3x3x3 With Feet)
- No opinion

### [ALL] The WCA currently recognizes 18 official events for an indefinite amount of time, and rarely adds or removes events. By contrast, "ephemeral" events could be recognized for a fixed amount of time (e.g. 2 years) and then removed to make room for new events. Would you be interested in ephemeral events as a way to regularly add new events?
- Keep permanent events
- Consider ephemeral events
- No opinion

### [ALL] Are there any events you would like to see the WCA recognize in the future?

### [EXPERIENCED] Big competitions sponsors can help a competition have a more expensive venue and better prizes, but they can make it harder for the WCA (which is a non-profit volunteer organization) to be known worldwide for competitions that are fun, under fair and equal conditions. Overall, would you prefer major championships to have big sponsors?

WCA Euros 2018 was a major competition without a main sponsor. If you'd like, you can read a case study about this event: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1woaO-OxAZQq3l13lauHHMEqVsX4v8tV7/edit

- Prefer no big sponsors
- Prefer big sponsors
- No opinion

### [EXPERIENCED] Red Bull is interested in collaborating with the WCA on competitions, but their actions and motivations have been controversial in the WCA Community (see [this announcement]). Do you think the WCA should consider collaborating with Red Bull?

- Prefer not collaborating
- Prefer considering to collaborate
- No opinion
