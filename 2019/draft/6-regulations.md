# Regulations

## [ALL] Do you think the WCA should keep 3x3x3 With Feet as an official event?

Please note that the WCA will take multiple factors into account when making a decision about 3x3x3 with Feet, not just the responses to this question.

- Yes
- Neutral
- No

## [ALL] Which events you would like to see the WCA explore in the future?

- Kilominx
- Redi Cube
- Gigaminx
- Master Pyraminx
- Team Blindfolded
- Speed Blindfolded (only solving time is counted)
- Bigger cubes (8x8x8 and larger)
- Bigger cubes Blindfolded (6x6x6 and larger)
- Mirror Cube Blindfolded
- Prepared Speedsolve
- Match the Scramble
- 15 Puzzle
- Multi-puzzle relays (e.g. the ‚ÄúGuildford challenge‚Äù)
- Linear Fewest Moves
- Fewest Moves Duel (head-to-head Linear Fewest Moves with a chess clock)
- Mosaic 
- Other: `[text field]`
- I would prefer not to see new events.

## [EXPERIENCED] What do you think is the best way to make room for new events?

- Event tiers, with events in some tiers held less often
- Temporary events (official for only a few years)
- Hold fewer rounds of existing events
- Encourage holding more experimental/unofficial events at local competitions.
- Other: `[text field]`

## [EXPERIENCED] In general, how confident are you in the ability of judges at your local competitions?

- Very confident
- Confident
- Neutral
- Insecure
- Very insecure

## [EXPERIENCED] In general, would you prefer if the Regulations were more lenient across the world, or more strict?

If the Regulations are more strict, then incidents could be handled consistently but competitors would receive more penalties (which is less fun to most competitors). If the Regulations were more lenient, then Delegates around the world may make inconsistent decisions (which still frustrates many competitors). 

- More lenient
- Neutral
- More strict

## [EXPERIENCED] Would you like to see ‚ÄúAverage of 5‚Äù (with an optional cutoff after 2 solves) used for 6x6x6 and 7x7x7?

- Yes
- Neutral
- No
