# WCA Community Survey (DRAFT)

## Feedback on this draft

If you'd like to leave comments on any questions, comment [on this Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PKIN5wOqbunIeNDQVyQH74BdahLGLimk6KZcaa1CT1U/edit#) or directly [on GitHub](https://github.com/thewca/community-surveys).

## Notes

- Responses will be associated with WCA profiles (it won't be possible to submit a valid survey without a unique code assigned to you).
  - Normal members will be asked to self-identify (TBD) as "new" or "experienced".
  - WCA Staff and recent organizers will automatically be categorized as "experienced" for the purposes of this survey.
  - Since responses are associated with profiles, we can use profile information for analysis, e.g. who has competed where/how often, world rankings, gender, how frequently they organize competitions, current/past WCA staff status.
  - WCA Staff and organizers will see the same questions. This helps keep the survey practical, and allows them to discuss the same survey topics with each other. During analysis, we can filter to see if there are significant differences in certain responses based on who organizes/delegates/is other WCA staff, and emphasize the results from the most relevant populations.
- We‚Äôre trying to maximize the number of pre-designated answers, so that the survey can be translated. For anything open-ended, we plan to use [response coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_(social_sciences)) to categorize the responses (with help from translators).
- We will randomize the order of response choices to avoid bias, when the order of the choices is irrelevant.
- We hope to reduce the number of questions for the final version. Please let us know which questions you think should be dropped or combined!
