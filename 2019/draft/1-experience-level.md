# Experience Level

**Note: WCA Staff and recent organizers will not see this page. They will automatically be marked as "experienced".**

**TBD: Should we automatically categorize competitors based on the number of competitions? (e.g. "new" if they've started competing in the last half year, or competed less than 3 times)**

## Do you consider yourself new or experienced?

If you select ‚Äúexperienced‚Äù, we will ask you more detailed questions.

- I haven't competed.
- I'm a new competitor.
- I'm an experienced competitor.
