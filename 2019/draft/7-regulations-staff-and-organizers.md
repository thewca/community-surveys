# Regulations (for WCA Staff and Organizers)

**Note: Only WCA Staff and recent organizers will see this page.**

## [STAFF/ORGANIZERS] How well do you understand the WCA Regulations?

Note: we don‚Äôt expect everyone to have the Regulations memorized! In fact, it‚Äôs usually better to look up the answer for any uncommon incident, since any Regulation may change from year-to-year.

- I‚Äôm an expert.
- I can answer most common questions.
- I know some important parts (e.g. Article A).
- I rely on practical knowledge rather than the Regulations.
- I haven‚Äôt read the Regulations.

## [STAFF/ORGANIZERS] Which simplifications do you think would be worth implementing in order to reduce the knowledge needed to resolve incidents?

- Select as many as you want.

- [ ] All slices must be aligned (e.g. within 45 degree limits for cubes) at the end of the solve. (+2 becomes DNF.)
- [ ] All pieces must be in place at the end of the solve. (Any missing piece means DNF.)
- [ ] Clock pins are all moved up at the end of scrambling. (The clock can be placed flat.)
- [ ] The competitor may move clock pins during inspection. (The judge would need to watch that they don‚Äôt turn clock dials.)
- [ ] FMC solutions are restricted to the 18 basic moves. (No rotations or wide moves.)
- [ ] Other: `[text field]`

## [STAFF/ORGANIZERS] The WRC plans to require scramble signatures for all competitions starting in 2020. Would you have any concerns with this at your local competitions?

- We already use scramble signatures without problem.
- Using scramble signatures would not cause problems.
- I have concerns: `[text field]`

## [STAFF/ORGANIZERS] At your local competitions, which of the following are commonly used to uphold scramble secrecy (Regulation 4b2a)?

Please keep in mind that only the designated Delegate for the competition may have access to passcodes/scrambles until right before the relevant group begins. If your local competitions are not using one of these, please email the WRC.

Select all that apply.

- [ ] Printed scrambles that only the Delegate has access to distribute.
- [ ] Digital scrambles, with passcodes read out loud by the Delegate.
- [ ] Digital scrambles, with passcodes distributed by the Delegate over email or chat.

## [STAFF/ORGANIZERS] At your local competitions, how practical would it be to isolate the Competitors Area from the _scramble table_ so that competitors cannot see scrambles?

- This scramble table is already isolated at most local competitions.
- This would not be difficult.
- This would be difficult.
- We would need to use different venues.

## [STAFF/ORGANIZERS] At your local competitions, how practical would it be to isolate the Competitors Area from the _stage_ so that competitors cannot see scrambles while waiting?

- This stage is already isolated at most local competitions.
- This would not be difficult.
- This would be difficult.
- We would need to use different venues.


## [STAFF/ORGANIZERS] At your local competitions, are you able to use O-rings (or similar button protections) to reduce timer resets?

- We already use O-rings.
- We don‚Äôt always use O-rings, but it would be easy to buy and attach them.
- We can‚Äôt attach O-rings because we don‚Äôt own all the equipment we use.
- We would need help acquiring O-rings.
